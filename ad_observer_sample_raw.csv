If you are worried about the divide in our country, you’re not alone. Those of us who love America understand that the loss of civil discourse, and the misguided push we’re witnessing to reframe America as a fundamentally unjust nation, are threatening the very unity in our country’s name. 

But we have a blueprint for healing our nation — it’s been with us for centuries. We have the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution! The more we study these founding documents, the better equipped we’ll be as citizens to restore a sense of national unity.

That’s why the Bill of Rights Institute has put together a new online course — “Civics 101: A Guide to American Life.” You can access it now, free of charge, and discover how civics can shape our American future.

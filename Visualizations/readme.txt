Welcome to the Vizualizations! This folder contains all the codes used to produce vizualizations used in this project and its presentation.

Before diving in, be sure Data_Prep.R is loaded and run in order to put all the necessary objects into your R environment. This way, you can run any of the other code files without worry. 
I highly recommend running the whole file, but if you'd just prefer to work in pieces, the pre-processing has been sectioned based on the objects and data characteristics that it describes.

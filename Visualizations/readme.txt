Welcome to the Vizualizations! 

This folder contains all the codes used to produce vizualizations used in this project and its presentation.

Before diving in, be sure Data_Prep.R is loaded and run in order to put all the necessary objects into your R environment. This way, you can run any of the other code files without worry. 
I highly recommend running the whole file, but if you'd just prefer to work in pieces, the pre-processing has been sectioned based on the objects and data characteristics that it describes. 

The code files tend to be a bit dense, so at the top of each file there is a "Recommended Object" Section commented out. You can highlight these objects directly from the comment and run them in order
to see the objects without having to scroll and search through the code for them. If you want to look at the other codes or objects generated along the way, feel free to use the Sectioning bar to 
make things a bit easier.
